## Hi there 👋

I am a second-year AI & Data Science student interested in building data-driven solutions.

Currently, I am strengthening my fundamentals in Python and Data Structures & Algorithms while learning core Data Science concepts such as data analysis using Pandas and NumPy.

I enjoy working with datasets, exploring insights, and building small projects to improve my problem-solving skills.
